    "- Every extracted text is accompanied with a bounding box representing in its location on the document.\n",
    "  - This can be useful to filter out headers and footers, diminishing OCR noise.\n",
    "- The service tries to extract role of each element (paragraph, header, section, etc).\n",
    "  - This could be useful to programatically reconstruct the document structure without AI. The bad news is: it is pretty bad, and fixing broken structures programatically can be more complex than parsing it with LLM.\n",
