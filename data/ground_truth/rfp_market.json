Originally established as a boutique equity shop serving university endowments, the firm has since evolved into a multi-asset class manager. Ownership: We remain 100% employee-owned, with equity distributed among 28 partners. This structure ensures that our incentives are fully aligned with the long-term success of our clients.

            "answer": "Our core philosophy is Fundamental, Bottom-Up, and Quality-Focused. We believe that stock prices eventually converge with the intrinsic value of the underlying business, but market inefficiencies often create dislocations in the short term. We focus on: 1. High Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): Companies with a sustainable competitive moat. 2. Strong Free Cash Flow: Businesses that can self-fund growth. 3. Prudent Capital Allocation: Management teams with a track record of treating capital as a scarce resource. We are not 'macro' forecasters; we build portfolios company by company, independent of benchmark weightings.",

            "question": "What distinguishes your firm from other public market investment managers? Why is your approach sustainable?",
            "answer": "Meridian distinguishes itself through Time Arbitrage. In a market obsessed with quarterly earnings, our competitive advantage lies in our willingness to hold positions through short-term volatility to capture long-term compounding. Research Depth: We do not rely on Wall Street consensus. Our analysts are career sector specialists who model businesses out 5–10 years, not 12 months. High Active Share: Our portfolios look nothing like the benchmark (Active Share typically >85%). We only invest in our best ideas, not index fillers. Behavioral Discipline: We have a codified selling discipline that removes emotion from the decision-making process.",

They are supported by a team of 12 sector-specific analysts. Tenure: The average tenure of the investment team is 9 years. Turnover: We have experienced very low turnover. In the last three years, only one analyst has left the firm (voluntary departure for business school). We have added two junior analysts during this period to deepen our technology coverage.",

            "question": "How are portfolio managers and analysts compensated? Is compensation tied to short-term or long-term performance?",
            "answer": "Our compensation philosophy is designed to discourage short-term risk-taking. Base Salary: Competitive fixed salary. Annual Bonus: Based on a combination of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year investment performance (weighted heavily toward the 3 and 5-year metrics) and qualitative contributions to the firm's culture. Equity Participation: Key investment professionals are invited to become partners, purchasing equity in the firm. This equity must be held for a significant period and is subject to clawback provisions, ensuring alignment with client capital preservation.",

            "answer": "We view liquidity as a key performance driver. ● Current Capacity: The Global Quality Growth Strategy has an estimated total capacity of $12 Billion. ● Closure Policy: With current AUM at $8.2 Billion, we have approximately $3.8 Billion in remaining capacity. We are committed to 'soft-closing' the strategy to new investors once we reach $11 Billion to ensure we can continue to trade efficiently without market impact diluting returns.",

Breakdown: ● Public/Corporate Pensions: 55% ● Endowments & Foundations: 25% ● Sovereign Wealth Funds: 10% ● High Net Worth/Family Offices: 10% Retention: Our client retention rate over the past five years is 96%.

            "answer": "Yes, Meridian is a signatory of the UN PRI (since 2014) and currently holds an 'A' rating. We practice full ESG Integration, not just negative screening. We view ESG not merely as a compliance checklist, but as a material risk factor: ● Environmental: We assess carbon transition risks for industrial holdings. ● Social: We evaluate supply chain labor standards and human capital turnover. ● Governance: This is paramount. We vote all proxies internally (never outsourced) to ensure management is accountable to shareholders. ● Note: Our analysts assign an internal ESG score to every company in our investable universe; companies below a certain threshold are ineligible for the portfolio regardless of valuation.",

            "question": "Describe the research process used to generate investment ideas. How large is your investable universe. How do you filter it down to a watchlist?",
            "answer": "a) Investable Universe Our starting universe consists of the constituents of the MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index), covering approximately 3,000 companies across developed and emerging markets. We focus primarily on companies with a market capitalization above $5 billion to ensure sufficient liquidity. b) Filtering Process to Watchlist We employ a 'Quality First' funnel to narrow this universe down to a working watchlist of approximately 150–200 companies. 1. Quantitative Screening: We run proprietary screens filtering for high Return on Invested Capital (ROIC > 10%), stable Free Cash Flow (FCF) yields, and manageable leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA < 3x). 2. Thematic Alignment: We exclude industries facing secular decline or existential regulatory threats. 3. Analyst Review: Companies passing the screens are assigned to a sector analyst for a preliminary review. Only those with a clear 'economic moat' enter the active Watchlist.",

            "answer": "a) Sources of Research We are an internal-research-driven shop. Over 90% of our investment inputs are generated by our 12 sector analysts. ● Internal: We build our own proprietary 3-statement financial models, projecting cash flows out 5 to 10 years. ● Sell-Side: We utilize sell-side research primarily to understand 'consensus' expectations and sentiment, rather than for idea generation. ● Expert Networks: We utilize networks (e.g., GLG, AlphaSights) specifically to validate supply chain dynamics or technical product advantages, rather than for general market views. b) Management Access Direct engagement is critical. Our investment team conducts over 400 management meetings annually, including on-site visits, headquarters tours, and competitor walkthroughs. We believe seeing a factory floor or R&D lab often provides insights that a spreadsheet cannot.",

            "question": "What is your target number of holdings? Describe: typical sector, country, or position limits (min/max)?",
            "answer": "Target Number of Holdings: We run a high-conviction, concentrated portfolio of 35 to 50 stocks. We believe diversification is preserved through revenue exposure rather than a sheer number of line items. a) Limits and Exposures ● i. Sector: We are benchmark-agnostic but adhere to risk guardrails. No single sector may exceed absolute 35% of the portfolio or +15% relative to the benchmark weight. ● ii. Country/Region: Emerging Markets are capped at 20% of the portfolio. Developed markets are unconstrained, though we monitor revenue source diversity. ● iii. Position Limits: ○ Maximum Position: 6% at cost, 8% at market value. ○ Minimum Position: 1.5% (we do not hold 'starter' positions; if it's in the book, it must matter).",

            "question": "What specific triggers cause you to buy a security? Conversely, what triggers a sell decision (e.g., valuation target, thesis violation, stop-loss)?",
            "answer": "Buy Triggers: A stock is purchased only when it sits at the intersection of Quality (verified moat) and Valuation (minimum 15% discount to our calculated intrinsic value). Sell Triggers: 1. Thesis Violation (The 'Broken Story'): This is an immediate sell. If the structural competitive advantage erodes (e.g., a loss of pricing power), we exit regardless of valuation. 2. Valuation Extremes: If a stock price exceeds our optimistic bull-case valuation, we will trim or exit to recycle capital into better opportunities. 3. Better Opportunity: We operate a 'one-in, one-out' philosophy. To add a new name, it must offer a significantly better risk/reward profile than the weakest holding in the current portfolio.",

            "question": "Describe your risk management framework. Is risk management independent of the portfolio management team? What systems (e.g., MSCI Barra, Bloomberg) do you use to monitor risk?",
            "answer": "Risk Management Framework: We employ a 'Three Lines of Defense' model. 1. Portfolio Managers: Responsible for day-to-day risk monitoring and sizing. 2. Independent Risk Team: Led by our Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who reports directly to the CEO, not the Investment Team. This ensures they can flag risks without fear of retribution. 3. Compliance: Ensures adherence to client-specific guidelines (e.g., restricted lists). Systems: We utilize MSCI Barra for factor risk analysis (monitoring unintended bets on momentum, size, or volatility) and Bloomberg PORT for daily liquidity and stress testing. The Risk Team produces a weekly 'Risk Dashboard' reviewed by the Investment Committee.",

            "question": "How does the strategy typically behave in down markets? Please describe your approach to capital preservation during periods of high volatility.",
            "answer": "Behavior in Down Markets: Historically, our strategy has exhibited a downside capture ratio of roughly 85%. This means if the market falls 10%, we expect to fall 8.5%. This resilience stems from our focus on companies with strong balance sheets and recurring revenue, which tend to hold up better during economic stress. Capital Preservation Approach: We do not tactically raise cash (we remain fully invested). During periods of high volatility, we high-grade the portfolio by rotating out of higher-beta cyclical growth names and into 'stable compounders' (e.g., Consumer Staples, Healthcare) or companies with net-cash balance sheets.",

            "answer": "The strategy invests exclusively in large-cap and mega-cap securities. ● Liquidity: 100% of the portfolio is invested in Level 1 securities. ● Liquidation Timeframe: We estimate we could liquidate 90% of the portfolio within 2 trading days, assuming we do not exceed 20% of the daily average volume (ADV) of any single security. This ensures we can meet client redemption requests without incurring significant market impact costs.",

            "question": "For international mandates, do you hedge currency exposure? If so, is this active or passive, and what is the typical hedge ratio?",
            "answer": "Strategy: We generally do not hedge currency exposure for our global equity mandates. We view currency fluctuations as a long-term wash that provides diversification benefits. ● Exceptions: We may implement defensive hedging via forward contracts only if a currency is deemed to be in a hyper-inflationary spiral or facing extreme geopolitical risk. Over the last five years, our hedge ratio has averaged 0%.",

            "question": "What is the historical annual turnover rate of the portfolio? How does this impact tax efficiency and transaction costs?",
            "answer": "Historical Turnover: Our annual turnover averages 20% to 30%, implying an average holding period of 3 to 5 years. Impact: ● Tax Efficiency: This low turnover results in a portfolio dominated by long-term capital gains, which is tax-efficient for taxable clients. ● Transaction Costs: Minimizing trading volume significantly reduces implicit (market impact) and explicit (commission) costs, preventing 'drag' on net returns.",

            "question": "For the last three calendar years, provide a high-level attribution analysis explaining the primary drivers of alpha (e.g., sector allocation vs. security selection).",
            "answer": "Our alpha generation is historically driven by Security Selection rather than Sector Allocation. ● 2024: The strategy outperformed the benchmark by +2.2%. ○ Primary Driver: Strong stock selection within the Technology and Industrial sectors. Our holdings in semiconductor equipment manufacturers and automation specialists benefited from increased capex spending, significantly outpacing the broader sector indices. ○ Detractor: Underweight exposure to the Financials sector during the Q4 rally slightly dragged on relative performance. ● 2023: The strategy outperformed the benchmark by +3.1%. ○ Primary Driver: Quality bias. As rates stabilized, the market rotated back toward companies with strong free cash flows. Our avoidance of unprofitable, speculative growth stocks (which sold off early in the year) was a key contributor. ○ Secondary Driver: Overweight positioning in Healthcare, specifically Life Sciences tools, which saw a rebound in valuation. ● 2022: The strategy outperformed the benchmark by +1.8% (protected capital better in a down market). ○ Primary Driver: Stock selection in Consumer Staples. Our holdings in pricing-power-dominant global brands were able to pass on inflation costs, preserving margins while the broader market compressed. ○ Detractor: Our structural underweight to Energy created a drag as oil prices spiked, though this was offset by the resilience of our core holdings.",

However, if the client prefers to invest via our Commingled Institutional Fund, the estimated Total Expense Ratio is: ● Management Fee: 0.60% (weighted average) ● Administration, Audit & Legal: 0.08% ● Custody: 0.02% ● Total Expense Ratio: 0.70% Note: Transaction costs (trading commissions) are capitalized in the cost of the security and are estimated at an additional 0.05% per annum based on our low turnover.",
