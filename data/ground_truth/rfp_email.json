            "question": "Moving dedicated IP addresses must be done with caution. Can you explain how you warm new IP addresses, how successfully you do this, your average time frame for this plan, and if/how you’re able to navigate the transition period were we to have an overlap of providers.",
            "answer": "NimbusReach Marketing Technologies Ltd recognises that moving to dedicated IP addresses requires careful planning to protect sender reputation and maintain deliverability. Our approach is methodical, data-driven, and proven to minimise risk. 1. IP Warm-Up Process Our IP warm-up plan is designed to gradually build a positive sending reputation with Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 1. Initial Setup • New dedicated IP addresses are assigned exclusively to London & Partners. • Authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) are verified to ensure proper alignment. 2. Gradual Volume Increase • Sending volume starts small, targeting highly engaged segments first. • Daily send volumes are incrementally increased according to a pre-defined schedule, ensuring ISPs recognise the IP as legitimate. 3. Monitoring and Adjustment • Real-time monitoring of deliverability metrics (bounces, spam complaints, inbox placement). • Adjustments are made to sending volumes and cadence based on ISP response and engagement performance. 2. Success Metrics • NimbusReach has a proven track record of successful IP warm-ups across multiple enterprise clients. • Key indicators of success include: • High inbox placement from the start of the warm-up. • Minimal spam complaints or blacklisting • Rapid establishment of sender reputation 3. Typical Time Frame • The average warm-up plan takes 4–6 weeks, depending on total sending volume and campaign frequency. • For very large senders (e.g., multiple millions of emails per month), we may extend to 6–8 weeks for optimal reputation building. • Progress is monitored daily, and reporting is provided throughout the warm-up period. 4. Managing Overlap with Existing Providers • If London & Partners transitions gradually from a previous provider, NimbusReach can manage overlapping sending periods: • Coordinated segmentation of sending lists to prevent duplicate sends. • Staggered IP warm-up alongside ongoing campaigns from the existing provider. • Monitoring of inbox placement to detect and mitigate any deliverability issues during the overlap. • This ensures continuous campaign delivery without negatively impacting engagement or reputation. 5. Deliverability Safeguards • Dedicated deliverability specialists provide oversight throughout the warm-up and transition period. • Use of engagement-based targeting during warm-up ensures positive interactions with ISPs. • Reporting dashboards provide transparency on inbox placement, bounces, and spam complaints.",
